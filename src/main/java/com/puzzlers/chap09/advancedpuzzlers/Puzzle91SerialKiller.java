/*
* If a HashSet, Hashtable, or HashMap will be serialized, ensure that its contents
do not refer back to it, directly or indirectly.


In readObject or readResolve methods, avoid invoking methods directly or indirectly on
objects currently being deserialized.

In summary, the Java serialization system is fragile. In order to serialize many
classes correctly and efficiently, you must write readObject or readResolve
methods [EJ Items 55â€“57]. This puzzle demonstrates that you must write these
methods carefully in order to avoid corruption of deserialized instances. The
readObject methods of HashSet, HashMap, and Hashtable are susceptible to corruption.
