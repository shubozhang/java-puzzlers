/**
 * 1. private members are fully encapsulated by the class that contains them.
 *
 * 2. serialization can break this encapsulation. Making a class serializable and accepting the default
 *    serialized form causes the classâ€™s private instance fields to become part of its exported API
 *
 * 3. Reusing names is dangerous; avoid hiding, shadowing, and obscuring.
